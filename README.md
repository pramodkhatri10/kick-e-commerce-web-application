# KICK:An E-Commerce Website
An e-commerce website which sells third party shoes at minimum price. 

# GOAL
To successfully built an E-commerce website using HTML, CSS, JavaSCript in the front-end, MySQL database and PHP for server side  and let the user buy the shoes from the website.

# Prerequisites
1. Setup virtual box machine and set up LAMP server. Connect MySQL database with the server phpmyadmin through XAMPP.
 OR
2. Directly run phpmyadmin through XAMPP (main and sql in htdocs inside XAMPP).

# Getting Started
> ## Front-End
### HTML
Developed the structure of the page *(Header, Navigation Bar, main or article, aside and footer)* of the webpage using HTMl5.

### CSS
Used CSS to control the webpages appearances including borders, margin, padding, , grids, flexbox, colors, fonts, adjutsment of elements and overall laying the contents in the page so that it looks organized and beautiful.

### JavaSCript
Used JavaScript in our specific parts of the webpages *(contact, account login & signup, payment)* to provide functionality like verification and validation to the user input.

> ## Back-End
### PHP&MySQL
Using PHP and MySQL, we created a dynamic web page which allows the clients to interact with the server and data stored, and produce results as per the user desire. We structured tables for the products, cart, user info, orders and order items. We designed in a way where table would drop if particular elements exits in the datbase and would not drop if there was no elements.Database was used to store the data of user as well as company products and info. Using php on server side, we made sure the database was connected. 

# Succeed
For majority of the parts we projected to design, we were able to structure the webpage layout. The web page was simple, clear to navigate and it would not take more than 3-4 click to the user to find what  they were looking for. Moreover, we have succesffully added functionality to menus of the nav bar also providing validationa nd verification for user on different forms. We were able to store the data in our database for records. And our main goal, Users were able to purchase the product from our website. 

# Failure
There is minimum we would want to improve on this webpage which I will say is to make CSS perfect.
